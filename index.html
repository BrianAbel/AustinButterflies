		<h5>I'll focus on how to set up a light sheet, photography, how to identify moths and what else shows up at the sheet. Then we'll look at day-flying moths and finding caterpillars. Finally we'll take a trip south of the border to see some tropical moths. 

Tom has always been fascinated with nature since early childhood and has carried that passion to this day. Since 2000 when he bought his first digital camera, Tom's been in the field and at his moth lights practically year round. In 2012 Tom's book, Insects of New England and New York was published. At his Groton, Ma. residence Tom has found and photographed over 1,730 species of moths in his yard.
