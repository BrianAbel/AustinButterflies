		<h5>Join us on Monday November 25th 7:00pm at Zilker Botanic Garden or on Zoom for our Annual Member Share Meeting of 2024 </a></H5> 
		<h4 style="color:blue;"><a href=https://us06web.zoom.us/j/87075327573?pwd=PqarwBK2Hg9KpaIRKP84dpg10Td4e4.1>Click here to join Zoom meeting</a></h4>		
		<h5>Description: Join ABF for our Annual Pizza Party and member presentations of butterfling activities. Topics can include activities such as rearing butterflies, nature walks with butterfly viewing segments, education, photography, gardening tips for butterfly habitats, etc. Presentations on mothing are also welcome! This is always a popular,fun meeting, and it's always varied and interesting. 
		We will also announce the winners of our photography contest. We received 25 entries submitted by six photographers, and it was not easy to pick the winners!  Since we're having pizza, please RSVP if you plan to come so we'll have enough!  Feel free to bring a drink or snack to share with others. This meeting will open with general socializing and ABF announcements. We have available upto six (6) slots for presenters at 10 minutes each. So please let us know if you would like to present. Contact Erin Guerra at butterfliesaustin@gmail.com. In case we are short on presenters by then, we will extend the invitation to non-members to present.
		the meeting will be held at the Zilker Botanical Garden Clubhouse at 7:00pm on Monday, November 25th and plan to end at 8:30pm and exit no later than 8:50pm. The garden clubs are still getting a grip on upgrades to the electronic systems in the general meeting room we use but we plan on having all the kinks ironed out so that Zoom is running smoothly for a successful hybrid meeting.</h5>
