		<h5>Join us on Monday October 28th 7:00pm at Zilker Botanic Garden or on Zoom for Presentation An Arthropod Biodiversity Project - The Nature Conservancy's Davis Mountains Preserve.Orthoptera Diversity and Biogeography in Texas." Presented by Ashley Schmitz </a></H5>

		<h5>Description: The Davis Mountains Preserve is about 33,000 acres and has been managed by The Nature Conservancy since 1998. This “sky island” is surrounded by the vast Chihuahua Desert in Texas. Plants and vertebrates have been well documented, but the arthropod community present in the preserve has not been comprehensively studied. Since 2021 a research team has been collecting specimens at the preserve, aiming to generate a comprehensive checklist of arthropods. To date, about 19 researchers with an additional 50 specialists are involved in the project, with over 1400 arthropod taxa currently recorded. 

Specimens have been deposited at several collections, both private and institutional. The Invertebrate Zoology Collection of the Museum of Texas Tech University has been designated to house voucher specimens for this project. Here we will provide information on how the specimens are collected, identified, and then transferred and digitized, with data available online via ecdysis. Also, the discoveries of new species and range expansions will be discussed.
