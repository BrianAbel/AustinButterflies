		<h5> Presentation by Stuart Marcus PhD: Zone 6 coordinator for the Lepidopterists’ Society and a Texas Master Naturalist:

Speakers Bio: My ten plus years of mothing started when I moved to a new office located on the Trinity River National Wildlife Refuge in 2012. I was amazed at all these unknown critters showing up under the security lights. My curiosity soon turned into a passion. It is now, as my wife jokingly says, an obsession! I have always been interested in all types of wildlife and got a degree in Wildlife Biology from the University of Florida in 1977. After working a short stint with the U.S. Forest Service in 1978, I started my career with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1979, retiring in 2019 with over 40 years of service. I worked at 4 refuges in Florida and then moved to Texas in 1994 as the Refuge Manager to start the newly created Trinity River Refuge in Liberty County with an initial purchase of 4,400 acres. When I retired, we had surpassed 30,000 acres. Honestly, during the last decade of my career, I was getting a little bored with all the administrative and personnel work I had to do. Low and behold, moths showed up at the new office after working in town at a storefront for 18 years. Now I could get back to some biology! I consider myself an avid citizen scientist, primarily photographing moth species at a single light setup. All the photos are sent to various websites for additional identifications and comments. I have also collected numerous species for various researchers over the years who have contacted me. I started a butterfly count on the refuge in 1995 and continue to do a yearly survey with help from some local butterfly enthusiasts. Additionally, in 2020 I became the Zone 6 coordinator for the Lepidopterists’ Society and a Texas Master Naturalist.
