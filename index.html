		<h5> Presented by Jessica Beckham -Associate Professor University of Texas at San Antonio.




		</h5>Presentation Description: It is estimated that there are over 1 billion insects for every human on this planet! Have you ever wondered just what they are all doing here, and why we have to deal with them? Let's face it -- the numerous services that beneficial insects provide to us are often overshadowed by the annoyances caused by "pesty" species. In this talk you will gain an appreciation for some of the unsung heroes of the insect world such as dung beetles, ants, lacewings, and parasitoid wasps as we discuss their biology, roles in ecosystems, and their benefits to humans. We will also look at some of the recent studies that have led to headlines proclaiming that we are in the midst of an "insect apocalypse," as well as how our everyday actions can help these critically important organisms.
