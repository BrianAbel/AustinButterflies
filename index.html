		<h5>Presented by Robby Deans PhD -Entomologist</h5>
		<h5>The Life Aquatic: How insects make their living in the water.
		Description: The common ancestor of all insects was almost certainly terrestrial, and in terms of diversity, insects are one of the most successful lineages on land.  Some insects, though, abandoned their land-lubber kin and have adapted to living in water.  In this talk, we will explore the diversity of insects (including Lepidoptera!) and other arthropods that live in water and some of the adaptations resulting from this transition.
        Bio:
        Robby got his PhD at UT Austin studying aquatic insect communities.  He worked briefly for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality identifying macroinvertebrates from streams.  He is currently an environmental specialist with the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality.  He is interested in the natural history of pretty much everything--especially insects, herps, and plants, and he enjoys hiking and macro photography.
