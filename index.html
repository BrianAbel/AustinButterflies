		<h5>Presented by  Dr. C. Barry Knisley, Wornom Professor Emeritus of Biology at Randolph-Macon College</h5>
		<h5>Description: INTRODUCTION:  Tiger beetles have been called 'the butterflies of the beetle world' due to their great beauty and the fact that there are numerous wonderful field guides with superb photographs or drawings as well as distribution maps. These factors make tiger beetles popular with many naturalists who in turn contribute much important data to scientists. The Austin Butterfly Forum is most pleased to have Dr. Barry Knisley speak to us about aspects of his life of tiber beetle research and conservation.
BIO:  Dr. C. Barry Knisley, Wornom Professor Emeritus of Biology at Randolph-Macon College, received a B.S. in Zoology and Entomology from Penn State University and an M.S. and Ph.D. in Entomology from Rutgers University. He began his 40 years of teaching in liberal arts colleges with the first 10 years at Franklin College of Indiana. With the opportunity for teaching courses more related to his area of expertise and pursuing research on tiger beetles, he joined the biology department at Randolph-Macon College in 1979. He has taught entomology, ecology, and a field course in desert biology in the southwest and tropical biology in Costa Rica. Most significant was his development of a field biology program and a requirement for biology majors to conduct an independent research project. His 50 years of research has focused on the biology and conservation of tiger beetles, resulting in over 80 co-authored papers and 5 books (Field Guides to Species of the South Atlantic States, 1997, and Field Guide to Species of U. S. and Canada, 2015, Tiger Beetles of New Mexico, 2023). He has conducted most of the research for 4 of the 5 tiger beetles currently on the Endangered Species list and continues to be active in tiger beetle conservation throughout the U. S. A primary goal of listing tiger beetles has been to insure the protection of significant natural areas for the tiger beetle and other species. He has worked closely with various government and private groups on tiger beetle conservation. His studies have been funded by the USFWS, Maryland DNR, National Park Service, BLM and various private conservation groups. Much of his research since the late 1980s has involved monitoring and research on the Northeastern Beach and Puritan Tiger Beetles in Maryland and Virginia. He was one of the founding members and past president of the Virginia Natural History Society.
