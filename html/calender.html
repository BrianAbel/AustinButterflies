Speakers Bio: My ten plus years of mothing started when I moved to a new office located on the Trinity River National Wildlife Refuge in 2012. I was amazed at all these unknown critters showing up under the security lights. My curiosity soon turned into a passion. It is now, as my wife jokingly says, an obsession! I have always been interested in all types of wildlife and got a degree in Wildlife Biology from the University of Florida in 1977. After working a short stint with the U.S. Forest Service in 1978, I started my career with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1979, retiring in 2019 with over 40 years of service. I worked at 4 refuges in Florida and then moved to Texas in 1994 as the Refuge Manager to start the newly created Trinity River Refuge in Liberty County with an initial purchase of 4,400 acres. When I retired, we had surpassed 30,000 acres. Honestly, during the last decade of my career, I was getting a little bored with all the administrative and personnel work I had to do. Low and behold, moths showed up at the new office after working in town at a storefront for 18 years. Now I could get back to some biology! I consider myself an avid citizen scientist, primarily photographing moth species at a single light setup. All the photos are sent to various websites for additional identifications and comments. I have also collected numerous species for various researchers over the years who have contacted me. I started a butterfly count on the refuge in 1995 and continue to do a yearly survey with help from some local butterfly enthusiasts. Additionally, in 2020 I became the Zone 6 coordinator for the Lepidopterists’ Society and a Texas Master Naturalist.

					<h5> Presented by Jessica Beckham -Associate Professor University of Texas at San Antonio.</h5>
					</div>
					
					<div class="contentBox"><p></h5>Presentation Description: It is estimated that there are over 1 billion insects for every human on this planet! Have you ever wondered just what they are all doing here, and why we have to deal with them? Let's face it -- the numerous services that beneficial insects provide to us are often overshadowed by the annoyances caused by "pesty" species. In this talk you will gain an appreciation for some of the unsung heroes of the insect world such as dung beetles, ants, lacewings, and parasitoid wasps as we discuss their biology, roles in ecosystems, and their benefits to humans. We will also look at some of the recent studies that have led to headlines proclaiming that we are in the midst of an "insect apocalypse," as well as how our everyday actions can help these critically important organisms. 

Bio of Yourself: Jessica Beckham is an Associate Professor of Instruction in the Integrative Biology department at the University of Texas at San Antonio; there she teaches entomology and zoology courses, primarily for environmental science majors. Her background includes broad training in entomology with a focus on the conservation of native Texas bumble bees. She is also a proponent of making science accessible to all through citizen science initiatives and is an active member of the iNaturalist community.

					</div>
					
					<div class="contentBox"><h5>Presented by Mike Quinn PhD. Entomolgist and board member Austin Butterfly Forum. Most people know that Texas is the most biodiverse state in the union, but why is that and where within Texas is that biodiversity concentrated?

The recent explosion of observational data can now augment collection-based entomological data to address these questions.

We will look at a variety of plant and animal data, of both vertebrates and invertebrates, overlain on ecoregional maps to explore United States biogeography.

Bio:

Mike Quinn's first biological interest was with the snakes of New Orleans where he grew up. After successive explorations of birds, botany and butterflies, he developed a deep curiosity in beetles. His fascination with true bugs is currently competing with his appreciation of beetles.

					<div class="contentBox"> <h5>Presented by Robby Deans PhD environmental specialist with the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality.</h5>
					<p>Description:
						The common ancestor of all insects was almost certainly terrestrial, and in terms of diversity, insects are one of the most successful lineages on land.  Some insects, though, abandoned their land-lubber kin and have adapted to living in water.  In this talk, we will explore the diversity of insects (including Lepidoptera!) and other arthropods that live in water and some of the adaptations resulting from this transition.
						Bio: Robby got his PhD at UT Austin studying aquatic insect communities.  He worked briefly for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality identifying macroinvertebrates from streams.  He is currently an environmental specialist with the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality.  He is interested in the natural history of pretty much everything--especially insects, herps, and plants, and he enjoys hiking and macro photography.

					</div>
					
					<div class="contentBox"> <H5>Description: Through an in-depth look at some of the published and ongoing research in the world of Auchenorrhyncha (true hoppers)—a group of small, jumping, sap-feeding insects—the ways in which citizen science is reshaping the way we understand insect diversity is illustrated. Topics discussed are the importance of people photographically documenting nature, experts disseminating their knowledge to the public, and the development of citizen science platforms that highlight the development of our understanding of insect ecology (through accommodations aiding research) and conservation (through clear presentation of information).Bio: Solomon Hendrix is a junior undergraduate student majoring in Insect Ecology and Conservation at the University of Delaware in Newark, Delaware. He is studying insect taxonomy with a focus on the Hemipteran suborder Auchenorrhyncha (true hoppers) under Dr. Charles Bartlett. He moderates and manages the identification and taxonomy of true hoppers on the sites iNaturalist.org and BugGuide.net, with over 200,000 identifications on iNaturalist and has emphasized citizen science as an important part of his entomological research. He is currently focused on the taxonomic revision of a genus of planthoppers in the family Cixiidae, Melanoliarus, with a number of smaller ongoing research projects. Introduced to entomology through macro photography and illustration, he has always been passionate about the interdisciplinary space between art and science.					</div>

						<h3>Exploring a Tropical Paradise: Cuba and Its Fantastic Biodiversity

							by Marc C. Minno, Ph. D.</h3>
						<p>Monday 02-22-2021</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="contentBox"> 
						<p>Since 2011 I have been working with volunteers and Cuban scientists to explore Cuba's extraordinary natural areas, document flora and fauna, and assess the conservation needs of the rarest butterflies. Cuba has some plant communities that are similar to those in South Florida including mangrove swamps, freshwater marshes, and dry tropical forests, but others have no equivalent such as savannas, scrubs, and pinelands on serpentine soils, moist tropical forests in the mountains, and arid, rocky shrublands. The island is one of the world's biodiversity hotspots with many endemic plants and animals. At least 210 different kinds of butterflies have been reported from Cuba and about 40% are unique to the island. Butterflies are often good at dispersing and there is exchange with Mexico, Hispaniola, south Florida, and other widely separated places.  This presentation will give an overview of Cuban culture, landscapes, and biodiversity.

						<p>Dr. Marc Minno-Bio</p>
						<p>

						Dr. Minno has a Ph.D. in zoology and more than 30 years of professional experience as an interdisciplinary scientist.  He is currently a Water Resource Coordinator with the Suwannee River Water Management District in Live Oak, Florida.  Marc and Maria Minno also work on plant and butterfly projects throughout Florida via Eco-Cognizant, Inc., their home-based consulting business.

						In addition to his many years of experience with wetlands, Dr. Minno is keenly interested in conservation biology and has conducted field research throughout the US and in Central America, South America, Caribbean, Europe, and India.  Since 2011 Dr. Minno has been working with biologists in Cuba to better understand the ecological relationships of imperiled butterflies in southern Florida.  He has authored/ coauthored six books and six book chapters on butterflies and plants.

						<h4>Male Sex Scales of Moths – Natural Wicks for Scent Dispersal


						Butterflies and moths have attracted much attention because of their colorful wing patterns derived from pigments inside their scales.   Males of many Lepidoptera have scales that lack pigments, but rather are used for producing and disseminating pheromones that are essential for mating success.  This presentation is based on examinations of the male scent scales of tortricid and gelechiid moths with a scanning electron microscope.   The images of magnified scales have revealed another kind of beauty with the structural innovations that increase surface area to improve dissemination as well as different ways of protecting the scent scales when not in courtship.

After serving as a medical entomologist in the U.S. Army at Ft. Sam Houston, I obtained a Ph.D. at Cornell University in 1980.  I was then employed as Director of the Mississippi Entomological Museum at Mississippi State University where I also taught courses in Insect Taxonomy, Aquatic Insects, and Immature Insects.   My research has concentrated on morphology and systematics of tortricid and gelechiid moths and has involved fieldwork throughout the U.S. and in Chile, Venezuela, New Caledonia, Fiji Islands, and Thailand.  Since my retirement in 2020, I have greatly enjoyed working full time on moths and manuscripts.

Her research seeks to understand how generalists solve the problem of balancing multiple and changing nutrient needs and how it affects their behavior and performance. She likes to use a physiological approach (the Geometric Framework) as a window into mechanisms underlying ecological patterns and processes. The overarching goal of her research is to use these insights to help establish sustainable management programs for herbivorous pests.

                    <h4>Presented By: Charley Eiseman a freelance naturalist based in western Massachusetts.</h4>
                    <h5>Description: Leafminers are insect larvae that spend at least part of their lives feeding between the epidermal layers of leaves. In North America they include over 2000 species of moths, flies, beetles, and sawflies, belonging to over 50 different families. These insects are typically quite host-specific, and the form of the mine varies considerably depending on what insect produces it. As a result, it is often possible to identify the responsible insect using only the host plant and mine characteristics. After a decade of reviewing the relevant literature, traveling throughout the continent, and collecting and rearing thousands of leafminers, Charley has completed a guide to the North American species that includes keys to the mines found on each plant genus. This slideshow presentation will introduce the major groups of leafminers, drawing all of the examples from among the 200+ species he found in his yard last year.

Bio: Charley Eiseman is a freelance naturalist based in western Massachusetts. He has been conducting plant and wildlife surveys and natural resource inventories throughout New England for over 20 years, as well as teaching courses and workshops on interpreting animal tracks and sign (both vertebrate and invertebrate). He holds an MS in Botany (Field Naturalist) from the University of Vermont and a BS in Wildlife and Fisheries Conservation and Management from the University of Massachusetts. Charley is the author of Tracks & Sign of Insects and Other Invertebrates (Stackpole Books, 2010), Leafminers of North America (self-published e-book, 2019), and an insect-themed blog called “BugTracks.” He has also published around 50 scientific papers on insect natural history, including the description of over 75 new species. http://charleyeiseman.com/   </h5>

They are the most speciose and biologically diverse among the 12 Scarabaeoidea families. Scarab aficionados have placed most of their attention on the Rhinoceros beetles (subfamily Dynastinae) because of their beauty, environmental impact, and, in some cases, impressive size. This presentation will cover Dynastine beetles morphology, life history, collecting techniques, and identification to tribe level. </h4>  
Bio: Originally from Honduras, Salvador works as an Entomologist for USDA-APHIS-PPQ based in Nogales, Arizona. All his higher education was obtained in entomology: Bachelor of Science from University of Florida, MSc. from Louisiana State University, Ph.D. from University of Missouri , and a Post-Doc at The Ohio State University. His work experience includes extension, research, teaching, administration, and the agrochemical industry. Salvador's applied entomological background includes integrated pest management (IPM) in cotton, pecan, small grains, field crops, and vegetables. His favorite obsession is documenting arthropods through macro photography. He has posted over 26,200 images in BugGuide (https://bugguide.net/) and manages a website called Southwest Bugs (https://elp.tamu.edu/ipm/bugs/) where he posts arthropods from Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. Salvador loves his current job to the point that he is not looking for a fancier position and is in no hurry to retire.  <p>

						<p>Aug. 24, 2020, 7 PM meeting: Insect declines: Current Research in the Appalachians & a Roadmap Moving Forward, presented by Graham Montgomery.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="contentBox"> 
						<p>Insect declines have become an important topic over the last few years, for good reason. Insects are such a key component of virtually all terrestrial ecosystems that downward trends in insect biomass and abundance are concerning to say the least. I'll touch on the current state of insect decline research, our efforts to standardize insect monitoring, and my ongoing research in Great Smoky Mountains National Park using historical insect and bird surveys originally conducted by the early ecologist, Robert Whittaker.</p>
						<p>I am a PhD student in Dr. Morgan Tingley's lab at UCLA, studying insect declines and their effects on insectivorous birds. I grew up in Houston, went to Cornell University where I majored in entomology, did biological field work for 3 years before starting graduate school. My PhD research focuses on using historical data as a baseline to better understand the drivers and consequences of insect declines, and I am currently doing insect and bird resurveys in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, among other projects. When I'm not in the lab or field, I enjoy macrophotography, playing basketball, and kayaking.</p>

						<p>sep. 28, 2020, 7 PM meeting:  John and Kendra Abbott will introduce their new book, Common Insects of Texas and Surrounding States that is to be released in October. They will talk about the layout and contents as well as the process for creating this book that contains 1,300 species and more than 2,700 photographs</p>
					</div>
						
					<div class="contentBox"> 
						<p> Thanks to its size and geographic position, Texas is home to nearly 30,000 species of insects, likely making its insect population the most diverse in the nation. Ranging from eastern and western to temperate and tropical species, this vast array of insects can be difficult to identify. In Common Insects of Texas and Surrounding States, John and Kendra Abbott have created the state's most comprehensive field guide to help readers recognize and understand these fascinating creatures.</p>
						<p>John and Kendra are professional nature photographers, educators and outdoor enthusiasts based in Tuscaloosa, AL. John is the Chief Curator and Director of Research and Collections for The University of Alabama Museums and Kendra is a Research Scientist in the Department of Biology..</p>
